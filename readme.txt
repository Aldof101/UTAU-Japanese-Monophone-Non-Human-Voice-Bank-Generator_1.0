UTAU-Japanese-Monophone-Non-Human-Voice-Bank-Generator_1.0 This archive contains consonants extracted from various open-source TTS voices, as well as some consonants I created myself, for use as learning and spectral reference material for non-vocal voice sources. The consonants cover Chinese, English, Japanese, and Cantonese. I standardized the Japanese consonants and included a Python auto-joining script. The script works by applying a crossfade at 55% of the consonant's duration before blending it with the vowel. You can adjust this percentage if needed. Chinese and Cantonese are more complex, and English has more extensive recording tables, so please select and join them manually. Before using the script, ensure you have a Python environment installed. To use it, update the paths:
consonant_path = r"this\is\a\PATH"
vowel_path = r"this\is\a\PATH"
output_path = r"this\is\a\PATH"
These correspond to the consonant path (you can use the Japanese consonants included in this pack), vowel path (ensure you have mono, 44100Hz, 16-bit WAV files for a.wav, i.wav, u.wav, e.wav, o.wav, and n.wav), and output path (where the joined syllables will be saved). On Windows, open cmd and enter python autojpn.py to run the script. Combined with Moresampler's automatic oto, this can help quickly test your non-vocal voice source. You can also change the paths to use your own consonant folders. This script is open-source and intended only for non-vocal voice source development and learning. Commercial or illegal use is prohibited. By Aldof.
